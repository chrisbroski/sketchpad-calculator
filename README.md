Sketchpad Calculator
====================

[Sketchpad Calculator](http://chrisbroski.github.io/sketchpad-calculator/) is a mobile web calculator with a UI based not on traditional calculators, but on how calculations are done with pencil and paper. Features include:

* Vertical orientation of calculations (like how you were taught in school)
* Running history of all past calculations
* Fast entry of previously entered and calculated numbers with a single touch
* Chain as many operations as you like and view them clearly on screen.
* How does "C" and "AC" work on a traditional calculator? Sketchpad Calculator don't care - it has no "clear" button. Every new calculation starts fresh with no mystery values invisibly tainting it.
